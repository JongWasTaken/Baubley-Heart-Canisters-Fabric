# Baubley Heart Canisters for Fabric
This is a port of [Baubley Heart Canisters](https://github.com/Traverse-Joe/Baubley-Heart-Canisters) for the Fabric Mod Loader.  
  
Please report any issues you encounter!  
  
This was mainly done as a learning exercise, but also because I wanted the cool 100 attack damage sword in my Fabric modpack.
  
## Downloads
[Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/bhc-fabric)   
[CurseForge](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/baubley-heart-canisters-fabric)  
  
I also recommend installing [Colorful Hearts](https://modrinth.com/mod/colorful-hearts), to make the heart bar more readable.
## License
Credits go to [Traverse-Joe](https://github.com/Traverse-Joe), I just did the porting, which took a few hours at best.
